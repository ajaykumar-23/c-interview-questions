C-programing:

1.Find the given number is a power of 2 or not ?

#include <stdio.h>
unsigned int countSetBits(int n)
{
    unsigned int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
int main()
{
   int i;
   printf("enter a number");
   scanf("%d",&i);
   printf("%d\n", countSetBits(i));
   return 0;
}

2.Change the bits in a particular places in a number(In hardcore)?

3.void pointer.

void pointer is also called as generic pointer.A void pointer is a pointer that has no associated data type with it. A void pointer can hold address of any type and can be typcasted to any type.
int a = 10; 
char b = 'x'; 
  
void *p = &a;  // void pointer holds address of int 'a' 
p = &b; // void pointer holds address of char 'b' 

#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int a[2] = {1, 2}; 
    void *ptr = &a;                                  //doubt
    ptr = ptr + sizeof(int); 
    printf("%d", *(int *)ptr); 
    return 0; 
}
o/p is 2. 
It has some limitations −

1) Pointer arithmetic is not possible with void pointer due to its concrete size.

2) It can’t be used as dereferenced.


4.About static keyword.

Initialized static variables are stored in the data segment of the C program whereas uninitialized ones are stored in the BSS segment.

Another information about static: If a variable is global and static, it has the life time of the C program, but it has file scope. It is visible only in that file.
There are 2 cases:

(1) Local variables declared static: Allocated in data segment instead of stack. Its value retains when you call the function again.

(2) Global variables or functions declared static: Invisible outside compilation unit (i.e. are local symbols in symbol table during linking)
