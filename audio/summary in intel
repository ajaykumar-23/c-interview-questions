Summary:
In intel i worked on GPMRB(Gordonpeak module reference board) and Apollolake NUC(Next unit of computing).
There some of the issues we are facing in audio.
1.ASoC no BE DAIs are enabled on GPMRB.
For this we have modified some files in sound/soc/soc-pcm.c
                                        sound/soc/codec/tdf8532.c
				        sound/soc/intel/boards/bxt_tdf8532.c
and created patch file,that patch file is added into the spec file and build the images using make build.
After that we got rpms,extract that rpms using rpm2cpio command.
After that create the boot and rootfs image.Then flash the images on the board using intel platform flash tool.
we are taking the logs using dmesg command.


2.HDMI audio not working properly on APL NUC. 
Tested in img 31050 APL NUC
APL NUC board is connected to the Samsung TV for test the audio.We are playing a video from video youtube.
Issue is first boot the audio from youtube is playing normally.
After first reboot the audio from youtube is breaking but video playing smoothly.
After second reboot the audio from youtube is not observed but video playing smoothly.

For that we are added debug prints in HDMI related files to localize the issue.
sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c
sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c
sound/pci/hda/patch_hdmi.c
sound/core/pcm_lib.c
For debugging purpose we are using FTRACE Function in kernel.For that we have to enable the following functions
in config file of kernel.
 CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER 
 CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
 CONFIG_STACK_TRACER
 CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE

We collected the dynamic debug logs using below command. 
sudo echo -n 'file pcm_lib.c +p' | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

For test the sound on the APL NUC we use aplay command.
aplay -Dplughw:0,3 example.wav
Here 0 is card number
     3 is device number i.e HDMI


gsg script for create boot and rootfs image.
ias image(intel automotive service image)
iasimage is a utility program for creating Intel Automotive Service (IAS) images, a binary file format understood by bootloaders to load and initialize Operating Systems or Hypervisors.
Create an image (including kernel cmdline, kernel, hypervisor binary etc.)
Attach a signature to an IAS image
Extract components from an IAS image
iasimage create -o iasImage -i 0x30300 -d priv_key.pem cmdline.txt bzImage initrd
for creating ias image we need bootargs.txt,private pem key and command line arguments.
