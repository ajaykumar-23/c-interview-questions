Following are the Xilinx Interview Questions for a Linux device driver developer post:
Round #1 of Xilinx interview questions
The first round was basic C questions and some of the Linux kernel questions.

Q1: How comfortable are you in C and data structures?
Q2: What is structure padding?
Q3: Write a program to detect if a system is little-endian or big-endian?
Q4: Can you write a program to convert big-endian to little-endian?
Q5: Why do we use copy_to_user() in kernel programs?
Q6: Why volatile keyword is used?
Round #2 of Xilinx interview questions
This was a short round and contain some generic and some specific questions to topics I have worked on my career.

Q1: Why do you want to change your job?
Q2: Have you notified your manager about your problems?
Q3: How a particular driver is called or loaded for a device?
Q4: Explain basic driver architecture.
Q5: How did you design your driver?
Q6: What is static and dynamic module linking in Linux kernel?
Q7: How an interrupt from your device propagates to the IRQ handler that you registered?
Round #3 of Xilinx interview questions
The interviewer was keep on questioning me on my understanding of complete system hierarchy and where do my driver sits in the system.
This was really an interesting round.

Q1: In which domain you worked?
Q2: What is SCSI?
Q3: How do data transfer happen in between the system and your controller?
Q4: Who initiates the data transfer?
Q5: How your driver is invoked by the system?
Q6: Can you explain the complete I/O propagation path?
Q7: What is PCI SR-IOV?
Q8: How did you implement SR-IOV in your driver?
Q9: How did you detect from your driver that you are dealing with a physical function or a virtual function?
Q10: What is Scatter/Gather?
Q11: Why do you need a Scatter/Gather?
Q12: Can you write a C program to remove a node from a single linked list?
Q13: What is little-endian and big-endian and how do you detect if your system is little-endian or big-endian? [Repeated question from Round #1]
Round #4 of Xilinx interview questions
This was again a short round. The interviewer just introduced himself and explained where I will be working if I will be selected.
As he was a Director of Hardware IP cores, so he just asked some of the basic questions from Linux device driver concepts.

Q1: How a an I/O propagates from an application to your driver? [Repeated question from Round #3]
Q2: How your driver is probed?
Round #5 of Xilinx interview questions
This was again a technical round with some of the questions repeated from other rounds.

Q1: Big-endian and little-endian? [Repeated question from Round #1 and #3]
Q2: How to convert a Big-endian DWORD to little-endian? [Repeated question from Round #1]
Q3: Have you worked in a multi-threaded environment?
Q4: What is synchronization in kernel?
Q5: What is sysfs in Linux?
Q6: Have you ever worked with kernel crash dumps?
Q7: What is NULL pointer de-referencing?
After this there was a final HR round. There were typical HR questions and nothing extra on this part. I hope this will give you some idea on where to concentrate before appearing for Xilinix interview.

Stay tuned for more Interview questions, tips and tricks and more device driver and web programming stuffs.

1.kmalloc arguments?
https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-kmalloc.html
https://www.tutorialsdaddy.com/linux-device-drivers/kmalloc-vs-vmalloc/      //kmalloc vs vmalloc
ans:void * kmalloc (size_t size,gfp_t flags);
size_t size:how many bytes of memory are required.
gfp_t flags:the type of memory to allocate
kmalloc is the normal method of allocating memory for objects smaller than page size in the kernel.(Linux supports two page sizes: Normal-sized pages, which I believe are 4kB by default on all architectures, though some architectures allow other values, e.g. 16kB on ARM64 or 8kB, 16kB or 64kB on IA64)
The flags argument may be one of:
GFP_USER - Allocate memory on behalf of user. May sleep.
GFP_KERNEL - Allocate normal kernel ram. May sleep.
GFP_ATOMIC - Allocation will not sleep. May use emergency pools. For example, use this inside interrupt handlers.

2.Interrupt handler?top half and bottom half?
https://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/kernel-api/re667.html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41257268/what-request-irq-does-internally
Ans:soft irq,work queue,tasklet and threaded irq are bottom halves.
request_irq — allocate an interrupt line
int request_irq (unsigned int irq,irq_handler_t  handler,unsigned long irqflags,const char *devname,void *dev_id);
Arguments:
irq
Interrupt line to allocate

handler
Function to be called when the IRQ occurs

irqflags
Interrupt type flags

devname
An ascii name for the claiming device

dev_id
A cookie passed back to the handler function

Description:
This call allocates interrupt resources and enables the interrupt line and IRQ handling. From the point this call is made your handler function may be invoked. Since your handler function must clear any interrupt the board raises, you must take care both to initialise your hardware and to set up the interrupt handler in the right order.

Dev_id must be globally unique. Normally the address of the device data structure is used as the cookie. Since the handler receives this value it makes sense to use it.

If your interrupt is shared you must pass a non NULL dev_id as this is required when freeing the interrupt.

Flags:
IRQF_SHARED	Interrupt is shared IRQF_DISABLED	Disable local interrupts while processing IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM	The interrupt can be used for entropy

19.can we use static in structure elements?
Ans:https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-not-possible-to-define-a-static-member-inside-a-struct-in-C
You can't take static inside structure as it is derived datatype. When memory is allocated to any structure variable, it is in continuous location. We can that It is structure's characteristics. 
If it were allowed to take one member static, then it is against this characteristics because static variables will be stored in data section and other non static variables will be stored in other region with respect to its scope; resulting into non-continous memory.
Though it is allowed in class in C++.

LinuxJunkies telegram group Questions?

1.How many of you know about Hard IRQ and soft IRQ in Linux? Why we need soft IRQ? How they implemented and behave in Linux?
2.Can anyone tell how the flow goes from hard irq to soft irq and further?
3.What happen when we free the pointer two times in memory allocation?
segmentation fault
4.How spinlock is different then these two?
5.What other things we should avoid using in interrupt handlers?
6.What does malloc(0) return and how free(addr) works?
Free will use pointer passed in argument to look for metadata allocated by malloc and then remove that metadata which will free the bytes which are registered during malloc. But still pointer will continue point to that memory until you explicitly make it null
Actually at OS level what happens when we use malloc function that time OS assigned one tag to that particular memory block which is assigned through malloc function.
After using the free function that tag was removed at memory block by the OS which means those memory block now free and it can be use by others resources.
7.In which context softirq runs?Why workquque uses sleep? In which context it runs?
 soft irqs run in Interrupt context.Workqueue runs in process context and you can use blocking function inside it according to your requirements.
8.What is the use of static function in drivers code? I saw in many functions having static at the beginning?
Static function is used for restricted that function scope within file only.
To restrict the use of that function to that file. Still there are some MACROs through which one can export functions to different driver files. 
e.g. EXPORT_SYMBOL()
9.what if we don't define these functions with static? What could be a possible impact?
10.Can anyone explain physical address and virtual addresses in detail with real time example?

14.When sound playing through headset and i want to play through speaker where should it changes path?             //Important
ANS:https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/refs/heads/android-msm-coral-4.14-r-beta-1/Documentation/sound/soc/dpcm.rst
Audio is being played to the Headset. After a while the user removes the headset
and audio continues playing on the speakers.
Playback on PCM0 to Headset would look like :-
::
                      *************
  PCM0 <============> *           * <====DAI0=====> Codec Headset
                      *           *
  PCM1 <------------> *           * <----DAI1-----> Codec Speakers
                      *   DSP     *
  PCM2 <------------> *           * <----DAI2-----> MODEM
                      *           *
  PCM3 <------------> *           * <----DAI3-----> BT
                      *           *
                      *           * <----DAI4-----> DMIC
                      *           *
                      *           * <----DAI5-----> FM
                      *************
The headset is removed from the jack by user so the speakers must now be used :-
::
                      *************
  PCM0 <============> *           * <----DAI0-----> Codec Headset
                      *           *
  PCM1 <------------> *           * <====DAI1=====> Codec Speakers
                      *   DSP     *
  PCM2 <------------> *           * <----DAI2-----> MODEM
                      *           *
  PCM3 <------------> *           * <----DAI3-----> BT
                      *           *
                      *           * <----DAI4-----> DMIC
                      *           *
                      *           * <----DAI5-----> FM
                      *************
The audio driver processes this as follows :-
1. Machine driver receives Jack removal event.
2. Machine driver OR audio HAL disables the Headset path.
3. DPCM runs the PCM trigger(stop), hw_free(), shutdown() operations on DAI0
   for headset since the path is now disabled.
4. Machine driver or audio HAL enables the speaker path.
5. DPCM runs the PCM ops for startup(), hw_params(), prepapre() and
   trigger(start) for DAI1 Speakers since the path is enabled.
In this example, the machine driver or userspace audio HAL can alter the routing
and then DPCM will take care of managing the DAI PCM operations to either bring
the link up or down. Audio playback does not stop during this transition.
